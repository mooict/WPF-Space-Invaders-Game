# WPF C# Tutorial – Create a Space Invaders game in Visual Studio

Welcome to this new tutorial from MOO ICT, in this tutorial we will cover how to make a fun and simple Space Invaders Game inside of Visual Studio using WPF and C#. For this tutorial we will use only the stock version of WPF and we will not be using any third party library or addons. We don’t need those as making games in WPF is simple and works really well just by using the default settings inside of Visual Studio. 

In this tutorial we will go over how to make this game step by step and we will also see how to simply apply different C# methods to the game so it works well with WPF. For the WPF and XAML part we will set up the Canvas, Label and the player rectangle and then we dive right into the C# part of the program. This part will be more detailed as we will make the dynamic objects during the run time of the game and we will also remove them from the game when we need to for example we will create the player bullet, enemies for the game also enemy bullet to interact with the player inside of the game. The player can move left and right inside of the canvas we will also make the game so player can shoot a bullet upwards inside of the canvas. 

We will be dynamically creating and arranging the enemies for this game and make the bullet and enemies interact with other whole the game is running. All of the components made inside of this tutorial will be explained. 

I hope you find this tutorial helpful and happy programming.
